      <h2>Why Do We Need Paradigms?</h2>
      <p>
        Programming paradigms exist to make our lives as programmers easier and to allow
        us to express our ideas more effectively. Think of them as templates or blueprints
        that provide a structured way to solve different types of problems.
      </p>
      <h3>1. Clarity</h3>
      <p>
        Paradigms help make code more readable and understandable by following a
        consistent set of rules. This helps both programmers and computers grasp the logic.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Efficiency</h3>
      <p>
        Each paradigm is designed for specific tasks, making code more efficient.
        It's like using the right tool for the job, reducing the risk of errors and improving
        performance.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Reusability</h3>
      <p>
        Paradigms often promote code reusability. Once you've solved a
        problem using a particular paradigm, you can apply similar solutions to other
        problems of the same type.
